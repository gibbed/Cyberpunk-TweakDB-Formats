# Cyberpunk TweakDB Formats

A set of JSON files that describe type information for Cyberpunk 2077's TweakDB (`tweakdb.bin`).

TweakDB is a database of tweakable data (thus the name) stored in a custom binary format. See [Gibbed.RED4 repository](https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.RED4) for more information.
